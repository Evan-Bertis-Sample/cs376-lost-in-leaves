Player : what about it?

...

it just clears your mind

doesn't it?

...

life has been really stressful lately

just, everyone...

...they are so caught up in it

the hustle and bustle

it stresses me out, you know?

i feel like i'm not doing enough

...

i just need to chill man...

...just look at the water

and watch the leaves fall

its peaceful

...

but i feel guilty, like i need to go work

but does work look as beautiful as this?

i don't think so...

...

sorry, lol

kinda just got caught up, looking at the water

so blue...
