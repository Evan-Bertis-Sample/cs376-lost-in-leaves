oh hey dude

Player : nice fire you got going there

yeah...

my dad taught me how to build one

its a bit chilly out, so i figured i'd put to use what that old man taught me

he said i'm better at making them at him now

he said to 'calm down bucko'

'yer gonna start a forest fire with this one'

don't know how he got that

i think i'm just okay at this stuff

my dad though, i think he could actually start a forest fire

dude was a pyromaniac

who else would teach a 5 year old to make a fire?

man do i miss him...

...

Player : yeah...

Player : he sounds like a cool guy

Player : in a way, he's keeping you warm right now

Player : ...

yeah, he is

sorry to bring that up

Player : it's okay, you're fine

so what brings you out to this part of the woods?

Player : honestly, im not too sure

Player : just felt like coming here would make me feel better

well, we can feel better out here together if you want

Player : that would be nice

just chill out with me, and look at the water

looks pretty majestic at night
